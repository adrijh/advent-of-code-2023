# Advent of Code 2023

This is my educational endeavor of learning Elixir by tackling the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Whether you're an Elixir enthusiast or just curious about how these puzzles can be solved in a functional language, feel free to explore and contribute.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `aoc2023` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:aoc2023, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/aoc2023>.
